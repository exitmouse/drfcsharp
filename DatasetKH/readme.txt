Natural/Man-Made structure data
---------------------------------

Following is the description of each tar file:


1. totalImagesTrain.tar

Contains 108 jpg images used for training


2. totalImagesTest.tar  

Contains 129 jpg images used for testing


3. totalLabelsTrain.tar 

Each training image was divided into a grid of 16 x 16 pixels
nonoverlapping blocks. Each such block was labeled to be a 'structure'
or a 'nonstructure'. In this work we labeled each block into THREE
labels.

'Edgy Structure' - parts of man-made structures that are edgy
'Smooth Structure' - parts of man-made structures that are smooth
(like regions of wall, roof etc.)
'Nonstructure' - natural regions 

This tar file contains 216 BINARY tif images. Size of these images is
16x24 pixels (or 24x16 pixels) and each pixel value is a label
corresponding to a block in the original image. Corresponding to each
training image 'zzz.jpg', there are two label images :

label1_zzz.tif :  value '255' means there is an 'edgy' structure
at that block. Value '0' means that the block is 'nonstructure'.

label2_zzz.tif :  value '255' means there is a 'smooth' structure
at that block. Value '0' means that the block is 'nonstructure'.


NOTES: 

(i). This three-class labeling was done for the purpose of advanced
reasoning about man-made structures. But for the man-made structure
detection work one would like to combine these two label images (
using 'LOGICAL OR' operation) and treat both structure
labels as 'structure' and rest 'nonstructure'.  

(ii). The labels might contain some noise due to block quantization error
and the 'human labeling errors'. 


4. totalLabelsTest.tar 

Contains 258 tif images, two images for each test image, in the same
format as the above tar file. Again for testing purposes a single
label image was generated by doing 'Logical OR' and treating the two
structure labels combined as the 'structure' label.
