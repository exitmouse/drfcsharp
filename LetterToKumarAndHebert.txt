Dear Professors Kumar and Hebert,	

	Jesse Selover and I are undergraduate students at Dartmouth College currently enrolled in a class on machine learning taught by Lorenzo Torresani.  For our project, we are working to re-implement the discriminative random fields algorithm which you presented for man-made structure detection in your 2003 and 2006 papers.  
	Jesse and I want to apply this algorithm to aerial orthophotos, and we are collecting and labeling our own training and test images for that purpose. Professor Torresani suggested, though, that we might contact you to see if we could get a copy of your data so that we could also check our implementation against known results. You mention in the 2006 paper that you used 237 images selected from the Corel image database.  Do you still have the images and their labelings, and would it be possible for us to use them?  
	We are also interested in knowing how you chose the size of the convolution kernel for the pixel gradient calculation.  Was there an a priori reason for this choice? Should one just go about selecting this as a hyper-parameter chosen through cross-validation?  
	Thank you so much for your time.  This is a very neat method, and we are having a lot of fun learning it.

Sincerely,

Dan Denton and Jesse Selover
