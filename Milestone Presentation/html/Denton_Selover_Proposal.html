<h2>Discriminative Random Fields for Aerial Structure Detection</h2>

<p>
The description and motivation of our project remain unchanged since 
the original proposal.  Therefore, we will begin at the point where the 
proposal writeup ended, with the tasks we set for ourselves to complete 
by the milestone date.
</p>

<h3>Recap: Milestone Goal</h3>

<p>
When we began this project, we set out to complete the following tasks 
by the milestone date:
  <ul>
    <li> Writing a short program to facilitate hand-labeling our
    data </li>
    <li> Hand-labeling the data </li>
    <li> Extracting features for each image (pre-processing) </li>
    <li> Coding the DRF model </li>
    <li> Training the DRF model </li>
    <li> Producing preliminary results </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
Now that the milestone date has arrived, we have completed almost all
of these tasks.  In short, we have written our data labeling program, 
and used it to label some (but not all) of our data.  We have successfully 
extracted from our images the feature set that our DRF model uses to 
make its classifications.  We have coded the complete algorithm, with 
both training and inference.  We have trained the algorithm on the 
subset of data which we have labeled so far, although we this using 
a default selection of hyper-parameters which we eventually intend to 
discover using cross validation.  Finally, we have used the trained 
model to classify sites on a few test images, and discovered that 
there is currently a bug in how we are applying the inference when 
we include the interaction potential term.
</p>
<p>
As long as we can find and fix our bug with the use of the interaction 
potential in a reasonable amount of time, we should be on track to tune 
the algorithm, and test its behavior on several datasets, including 
some used by previous researchers [1], [6].
</p>


<h3>Data Labeling</h3>
<p>
We began by deciding to use images of 256x256 pixels split into 256 
16x16 pixel sites (the same site size used by Kumar and Hebert [6]).  
Since the images we acquired from the Montgomery County GIS website 
[8] were larger than this, we used a script to randomly crop each 
image to the desired size.  We also had the same script randomly 
rotate each of our images, because we are interested in performing 
structure detection which is not dependent on compass orientation.
</p>
<p>
Since we need to label 16x16=256 sites for each image, and we intend 
to label 300 of our own images along with some images from the datasets 
of previous researchers, it was imperative that we create a tool 
which simplifies and speeds up the process of creating and storing 
site labelings.  We decided to use python for our data labeling program, 
because the pygame library provides such great tools for easily creating 
a simple point and click application.

</p>

<p>
One idea that we have been playing around with is to try training the 
model with labelings of only buildings, and also with labelings which 
label every man-made structure (including roads, and driveways, etc.) 
to compare the results.  Thus, we wrote the data labeler to allow us 
to use 3 labels, which form a totally ordered set:
  <ul>
    <li> any_site</li>
    <li> any_structure </li>
    <li> building </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  We were fortunate to find a public online archive of high-quality
  orthophotos of the entirety of Montgomery County, Maryland at the
  Montgomery County GIS website [5].  We intend to use selections from
  this archive for our training and test data.  Since we will be
  performing supervised learning, each of these images will require
  labeling.  We plan to write a program to assist us in labeling our
  images.  Our program will superimpose a grid showing the site
  divisions, and and it will serve to capture site-labelings as user
  user mouse clicks.  In this manner we can reasonably expect to label
  and use a couple hundred such images.
</p>

<h3>Milestone Goal</h3>
<p>
  By the milestone we aim to complete the following tasks:
  <ul>
    <li> Writing a short program to facilitate hand-labeling our
    data </li>
    <li> Hand-labeling the data </li>
    <li> Extracting features for each image (pre-processing) </li>
    <li> Coding the DRF model </li>
    <li> Training the DRF model </li>
    <li> Producing preliminary results </li>
  </ul>
