DRFCSharp.exe train <model file> [-o other model file, else it overwrites]
DRFCSharp.exe train [--params model parameters file] <directory with images> [directory with labels] [-o model file, else it names it a.out]
DRFCSharp.exe predict <model file> [--infer inference method] <images or directory> [-o outfile, else prints the csvs to stdout]
DRFCSharp.exe test [--params feature parameters file] <images or directory> [-o outfile, else prints to stdout]

Model files contain all the model parameters as well as the list of images and labels they were trained on
Feature parameters files are a superset of model parameters files: they just check for the presence of the feature stuff part of the file.
Model parameters files look like this:
