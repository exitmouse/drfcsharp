<h2>Discriminative Random Fields for Aerial Structure Detection</h2>
<h4 id="authors">Daniel Denton and Jesse Selover</h4>

<h3>Project</h3>

<p>
  We have chosen to work on a computer vision problem: labeling
  regions of an image depending on the presence or absence of man-made
  structures. We hope to replicate the results of Kumar and Hebert
  [2], who applied a novel model to the problem that they called
  Discriminative Random Fields (DRFs). Our interest is largely derived from
  our desire to code this algorithm, but the
  problem of detecting man-made structures in computer vision is
  important in its own right.  Successful computer analysis of images
  to detect buildings and other man-made structures is useful for
  classification, retrieval, surveillance, and other applications [3].
</p>
<p>
  In particular, we think that it will be fun to use aerial photos in
  our project, rather than the stock ground-level photos used by Kumar
  and Hebert. Structure detection from the air can be especially
  important for military and law enforcement surveillance, search and
  rescue, disaster relief, or even estimating building density
  statistics that can be used for calculations relating to urban
  sprawl.  Working with aerial photos has the added benefit of
  standardizing our input images and making the problem slightly
  easier.  Orthophotos are aerial photos geometrically corrected so
  that the scale is uniform, and perspective effects due to the
  distance to the camera have been removed [7]. These attributes make
  them ideal to study. Due to their importance for applications like
  mapping and zoning, there is a plethora of high-quality orthophotos
  available online.  Thus, we had little trouble finding data sources
  which would suit our needs.  The camera position in these photos
  also means that lines in man-made structures typically meet at right
  angles, which are favored by the detection features Kumar and Hebert
  used [3].
</p>
<p>
  We should note that significant work has already been done
  on structure (specifically building) recognition from aerial photos.
  For example, Bellman and Shortis claim to have achieved
  classification success rates of higher than 80% using wavelet
  analysis and support vector machines [1].  Similar rates have been
  achieved by Shi et al. [6].  However, so far, none of the works we
  have looked at have used DRFs.  It will be interesting to compare
  our classification rate to their already-successful results.
</p>


<h3>Method</h3>
<p>
  Discriminative Random Fields are a type of Conditional Random Field,
  (defined by Lafferty et al. [4]). Kumar and Hebert [2] provided an
  example of a Conditional Random Field for machine learning that was
  based on a lattice rather than a tree, generalizing Lafferty et
  al.'s work to the case of images.
</p>
<p>
  Following the procedure of Kumar and Hebert [3], we will break the
  images into small sites, and assign a vertex of a lattice to each
  site. Then we will model the conditional probability that a site
  contains man-made structures according to a DRF. We intend to use
  the same methodology that Kumar and Hebert used, although we will
  have to tweak some of the aspects of the feature set and
  hyperparameters to better suit our specific application.
</p>


<h3>Data</h3>
<p>
  We were fortunate to find a public online archive of high-quality
  orthophotos of the entirety of Montgomery County, Maryland at the
  Montgomery County GIS website [5].  We intend to use selections from
  this archive for our training and test data.  Since we will be
  performing supervised learning, each of these images will require
  labeling.  We plan to write a program to assist us in labeling our
  images.  Our program will superimpose a grid showing the site
  divisions, and and it will serve to capture site-labelings as user
  user mouse clicks.  In this manner we can reasonably expect to label
  and use a couple hundred such images.
</p>

<h3>Milestone Goal</h3>
<p>
  By the milestone we aim to complete the following tasks:
  <ul>
    <li> Writing a short program to facilitate hand-labeling our
    data </li>
    <li> Hand-labeling the data </li>
    <li> Extracting features for each image (pre-processing) </li>
    <li> Coding the DRF model </li>
    <li> Training the DRF model </li>
    <li> Producing preliminary results </li>
  </ul>
</p>
